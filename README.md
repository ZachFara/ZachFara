# Zachariah Farahany

Hello! I’m Zachariah Farahany, an MS candidate in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago, with a BS in Computer Science and Math from Marquette University. I specialize in data science, machine learning, and AI, and am driven by a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights.

## Professional Experience

Currently, I’m an AI Solutions Consultant at Chartwell Insurance Services, where I implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and advanced NLP models, significantly enhancing customer service operations. Previously, I was a Quantitative Analytics Intern at Wells Fargo in the AI & ML Center of Excellence, where I improved a generative AI chatbot with transformer-based classification and tackled bias mitigation.

With over 4 years of hands-on experience, I have developed expertise in areas ranging from statistical anomaly detection and healthcare analytics to large-scale ETL pipelines and deep learning for image generation.

## Key Projects

- [SkySearch UAVs](https://github.com/duncancalvert/SkySearch): Developed SkySearch, an advanced UAV computer vision system that leverages zero-shot learning and multimodal large language models to autonomously locate and navigate to virtually any object, achieving significant improvements in search accuracy and generalization over traditional UAV systems.
- [Oversampling Techniques for Predicting COVID-19 Patient Length-of-Stay](https://github.com/ZachFara/Oversampling-Techniques-for-Predicting-COVID-19-Patient-Length-of-Stay): Developed a model using Electronic Health Records (EHR) and oversampling techniques to predict COVID-19 severity, measured by patient length of stay, with an Artificial Neural Network optimized through Bayesian hyperparameter tuning.
