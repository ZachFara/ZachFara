# Zachariah Farahany

Hello! I’m Zachariah Farahany, an MS graduate in Applied Data Science from the University of Chicago, with a BS in Computer Science and Math from Marquette University. I specialize in data science, machine learning, and AI, and am driven by a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights.

## Professional Experience

I’m currently a **Quantitative Analytics Associate at Wells Fargo**, where I work on model development, credit risk analytics, and AI/ML applications in financial services. Previously, I served as an AI Solutions Consultant at Chartwell Insurance Services, where I implemented retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and advanced NLP models to enhance customer service operations.  

With over 4 years of hands-on experience, I have developed expertise in areas ranging from statistical anomaly detection and healthcare analytics to large-scale ETL pipelines and deep learning for image generation.

## Key Projects

- [Chartwell Insurance AI](https://github.com/ZachFara/Chartwell-Insurance-AI): Designed and deployed an AI-powered assistant for insurance services, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, secure document retrieval, and advanced NLP to handle client queries with accuracy and compliance in mind.

- [SkySearch UAVs](https://github.com/duncancalvert/SkySearch): Developed SkySearch, an advanced UAV computer vision system that leverages zero-shot learning and multimodal large language models to autonomously locate and navigate to virtually any object, achieving significant improvements in search accuracy and generalization over traditional UAV systems.
